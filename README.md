## An Interactive Exercise

In this Jupyter notebook exercise, you will carry out some basic analyses of stellar data from MESA using the PyMesaReader Python library. The notebook is self-contained, and includes both the commands needed to install PyMesaReader as well as examples to analyze both history and profile data from a sample MESA run.
