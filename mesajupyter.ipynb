We change into a directory with the LOGS directory for a MESA run, and read in the <code>history.data</code> file, which is stored in the LOGS directory. We then store the log of the effective surface temperature and the log of the stellar luminoisty as log_Teff and Log_L, respectively. These quantities are stored as NumPy arrays, and are then plotted to form the HR diagram.\n",

Individual timesteps in the MESA simulation are called _models_ in MESA terminology, while the spatially-dependent stellar structure functions ($\\rho (r), T (r)$, etc.) are called _profiles_. In this example, we plot the profile of temperature and density within the star for the final profile stored during a MESA run.\n",

Be careful -- Python is case sensitive, so <code>R</code> is _not_ equivalent to <code>r</code>.\n",

Profile entries marked with a leading <\\code>!</code> are commented out. Simply delete the leading <\\code>!</code> to comment that field in. Some important profile fields are commented out by default, and you should consider adding them back in, including <code>luminosity, net_nuclear_energy</code>. Also the global entry <code>star_age</code>, which has only a single value per profile, allows you to easily connect a given profile to a physical time."
